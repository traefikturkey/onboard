# HTMX 2.0 Enhancement Plan

This directory contains planning and implementation details for upgrading our HTMX usage to take advantage of new features and extensions available in HTMX 2.0.

## Overview

Our application currently uses basic HTMX functionality (load triggers with outerHTML swaps) which works well but leaves significant performance and UX improvements on the table. HTMX 2.0 introduces several extensions and features that could dramatically improve the user experience.
