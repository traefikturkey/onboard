# Prompt Automation Feature

## Overview
Create a reusable prompt that can replicate the instruction improvement workflow we just completed. This prompt should analyze conversation history, identify patterns, consolidate improvements, and implement changes across the instruction ecosystem.

## Goal
Generate `.github/prompts/update-instructions.prompt.md` that contains a comprehensive prompt for automated instruction improvements based on conversation history analysis.

## Context
We just completed a manual process that:
1. Analyzed conversation history files in `.specstory/history/*.md`
2. Identified 14 common interaction issues
3. Consolidated improvements into actionable patterns
4. Updated 7 instruction files with uv-first approach
5. Created VERSION timestamp for tracking
6. Verified all changes with tests

## Deliverables
- Feature specification document
- Step-by-step implementation plan
- Comprehensive prompt file at `.github/prompts/update-instructions.prompt.md`
- Documentation for future usage

## Success Criteria
The generated prompt should be able to:
- Recreate the entire instruction improvement workflow
- Analyze new conversation history since last VERSION timestamp
- Apply consolidated improvement patterns systematically
- Maintain consistency with our instruction file ecosystem
- Include proper verification and testing steps
