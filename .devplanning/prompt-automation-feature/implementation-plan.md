- [x] Identify decision points and branching logic
- [x] Capture file selection criteria
- [x] Document verification steps

### Step 3: Create Prompt Structure
- [x] Design main workflow sections
- [x] Define input/output formats
- [x] Plan error handling approaches
- [x] Structure verification checkpoints

## Phase 2: Prompt Development

### Step 4: Core Workflow Implementation
- [x] Historical analysis section
- [x] Pattern recognition logic
- [x] File mapping strategies
- [x] Implementation sequencing

### Step 5: Instruction File Templates
- [x] Python instruction patterns
- [x] Docker/container patterns
- [x] Testing framework patterns
- [x] Makefile patterns
- [x] Core copilot instruction patterns

### Step 6: Verification Framework
- [x] Test execution commands
- [x] Git operation sequences
- [x] Error detection patterns
- [x] Success validation criteria

## Phase 3: Testing and Refinement

### Step 7: Prompt Validation
- [x] Dry-run simulation
- [x] Test against current state
- [x] Verify all file paths and commands
- [x] Check instruction file syntax

### Step 8: Documentation
- [x] Usage instructions
- [x] Troubleshooting guide
- [x] Example scenarios
- [x] Maintenance procedures

### Step 9: Integration
- [x] Place prompt in `.github/prompts/`
- [x] Update project documentation
- [x] Create usage examples
- [x] Document for future maintainers

## Detailed Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Workflow Extraction
**Inputs**: 
- Git commit 07dcdbd changes
- `.devplanning/prompt-improvements-2025-09-14/` analysis
- Current instruction file state

**Process**:
1. Map each instruction file change to improvement pattern
2. Document the decision logic for file selection
3. Extract the exact text replacement patterns used
4. Identify the verification commands executed

**Outputs**:
- Workflow sequence document
- Decision matrix for file updates
- Template patterns for common changes

### Task 2: Pattern Codification
**Inputs**:
- 14 improvement patterns from determined-issues.md
- Instruction file mapping logic
- uv-first implementation examples

**Process**:
1. Convert each pattern into prompt instructions
2. Create conditional logic for pattern application
3. Define file-specific customization rules
4. Build verification checkpoints

**Outputs**:
- Pattern application rules
- File-specific instruction templates
- Verification command sequences

### Task 3: Prompt Assembly
**Inputs**:
- Workflow sequence
- Pattern application rules
- Verification framework
- Error handling strategies

**Process**:
1. Structure main prompt sections
2. Integrate decision logic
3. Add verification checkpoints
4. Include error recovery procedures

**Outputs**:
- Complete prompt file
- Usage documentation
- Test validation plan
