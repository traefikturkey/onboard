# Feature Specification: Automated Instruction Improvement Prompt

## Feature Description
Create a comprehensive prompt that automates the instruction improvement workflow by analyzing conversation history and systematically updating instruction files based on identified patterns.

## Core Components

### 1. Historical Analysis Engine
- **Input**: Conversation history files in `.specstory/history/*.md`
- **Process**: Parse each file for interaction patterns and AI/user issues
- **Output**: Structured analysis of common problems

### 2. Pattern Recognition System
- **Input**: Analysis results from historical review
- **Process**: Identify recurring themes and consolidate into actionable patterns
- **Output**: Prioritized list of instruction improvements

### 3. Instruction File Orchestration
- **Input**: Consolidated improvement patterns
- **Process**: Map improvements to appropriate instruction files based on `applyTo` patterns
- **Output**: Systematic updates across the instruction ecosystem

### 4. Verification Framework
- **Input**: Updated instruction files
- **Process**: Run tests, validate git operations, check for errors
- **Output**: Confirmation of successful implementation

## Technical Requirements

### File Structure
```
.github/
└── prompts/
    └── update-instructions.prompt.md
```

### Dependencies
- Existing instruction files in `.github/instructions/`
- Main copilot instructions in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- VERSION timestamp file for tracking analysis points
- Test suite for verification

### Integration Points
- Must work with current `.specstory/history/` file structure
- Must respect existing `applyTo` patterns in instruction files
- Must maintain uv-first approach for Python projects
- Must create/update VERSION timestamp for future analysis

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Historical Analysis
The prompt must:
- Parse all `.md` files in `.specstory/history/` since last VERSION timestamp
- Extract interaction issues between user and AI
- Identify problems AI encountered while solving requests
- Create structured documentation of findings

### FR2: Pattern Consolidation
The prompt must:
- Group similar issues across multiple conversations
- Prioritize patterns by frequency and impact
- Generate actionable improvement suggestions
- Map improvements to appropriate instruction files

### FR3: Systematic Implementation
The prompt must:
- Update instruction files with consolidated improvements
- Maintain consistent language and formatting
- Ensure uv-first approach for Python tooling
- Add comprehensive examples where needed

### FR4: Verification and Tracking
The prompt must:
- Run full test suite to verify changes
- Create git commit with detailed changelog
- Update VERSION timestamp
- Report success/failure status

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Maintainability
- Prompt should be self-documenting
- Include clear step-by-step workflow
- Provide troubleshooting guidance
- Support incremental improvements

### NFR2: Reliability
- Include error handling for missing files
- Graceful degradation when history is limited
- Validation of instruction file updates
- Rollback guidance for failed implementations

### NFR3: Consistency
- Maintain existing instruction file patterns
- Preserve user-specific customizations
- Follow established markdown formatting
- Align with project coding standards

## User Stories

### US1: As a maintainer
I want to run a single prompt that analyzes recent conversations and improves our instruction files, so that I can systematically enhance AI assistance quality without manual effort.

### US2: As a developer
I want the instruction improvements to be tested and verified, so that I can trust the changes won't break existing workflows.

### US3: As a future user
I want the improvement process to be repeatable and trackable, so that instruction quality continuously improves over time.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Complete Workflow Automation
- [ ] Single prompt recreates entire manual process
- [ ] No human intervention required for standard cases
- [ ] Clear progress reporting throughout execution

### AC2: Quality Assurance
- [ ] All instruction file updates are syntactically correct
- [ ] Test suite passes after implementation
- [ ] Git commit includes comprehensive changelog

### AC3: Future Compatibility
- [ ] VERSION timestamp enables incremental analysis
- [ ] Prompt can be run repeatedly without conflicts
- [ ] New conversation patterns are automatically incorporated

## Implementation Risks

### Risk 1: File Format Changes
**Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation**: Include format validation and graceful handling of unexpected structures

### Risk 2: Instruction File Conflicts
**Impact**: High
**Mitigation**: Backup existing files before changes, provide rollback instructions

### Risk 3: Pattern Recognition Accuracy
**Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation**: Manual review checkpoints, conservative change approach

## Success Metrics
- Successful recreation of our manual improvement process
- 100% test pass rate after implementation
- Clean git commit with no manual fixups required
- Comprehensive instruction file coverage
