# .devplanning

Purpose: hold small planning artifacts for short-lived developer work and feature plans.

Files:
- `feature_plan.md` â€” actionable plan and checklist for fixes related to layout parsing, test seams, feed parsing and caching.

This directory is intended to be lightweight and ephemeral; keep plans focused and link to PRs/commits that implement the work.
