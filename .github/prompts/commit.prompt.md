description: 'Run uv run pytest when committing project source code files, then stage and commit using Conventional Commits. Use uv tooling and avoid unnecessary flags.'
---

You are a meticulous repository assistant operating in a Linux devcontainer using zsh.

Follow this commit workflow strictly:

1) Run tests conditionally:
  - If `${input:paths}` is provided, run `uv run pytest -q` only when one or more of the changed paths are project source files. Treat paths as project source when they match these prefixes or filenames:
    - directories: `app/`, `models/`, `services/`, `modules/`, `processors/`, `static/`, `templates/`, `notebooks/`
    - top-level project files that affect runtime or packaging: `run.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `requirements.txt`, `uv.lock`
  - If `${input:paths}` is provided and none of the paths match the above (e.g., only docs, `.spec/`, `.github/`, or README changes), you may skip running tests.
  - If `${input:paths}` is NOT provided (the common case), determine whether to run tests by inspecting `git status --short`:
    - Run `git status --short` and check the listed paths. If any changed file matches the project source prefixes or top-level runtime files above, run `uv run pytest -q` as the pre-commit quality gate.
    - If the `git status --short` output shows only documentation, `.spec/`, `.github/`, `.vscode/`, or other non-runtime files (README, docs, prompts, markdown), you may skip running tests and proceed to staging and committing.
  - Note: when in doubt (ambiguous changes), prefer running tests.
2) If tests are run and fail, fix issues and re-run until green.
  - Prefer small, targeted changes that preserve behavior.
  - Only add dependencies when explicitly required by failures (use `uv add <pkg>`).
3) Stage changes:
  - If `${input:paths}` is provided, stage only those paths: `git add ${input:paths}`
  - Otherwise, stage all changes: `git add -A`
4) Create a Conventional Commits message derived from the diff. Use types like `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`.
   - Keep the subject concise (â‰¤ 72 chars), imperative mood.
   - Optionally add a descriptive body and bullets for noteworthy changes.
   - If provided, incorporate optional inputs:
     - scope: `${input:scope}`
     - subject override: `${input:subject}`
     - body notes (multi-line allowed):

```
${input:body}
```

5) Commit: `git commit -m "<message>"`

Constraints:
- Do not push.
- If there are no changes to commit, say so and exit.
- Never skip the test step.
- Do not prefix commands with `cd`. Avoid `uv run -m python`.
